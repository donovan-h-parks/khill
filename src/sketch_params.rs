//! This module defines the `SketchParams` struct, which encapsulates the parameters
//! required to configure and create FracMinHash sketches, such as k-mer length, scale,
//! and whether the sketch is weighted. It provides methods for constructing new parameter
//! sets, accessing individual parameters, creating sketchers, and checking compatibility
//! between different parameter sets.
